### Description [ Також опис українською доступний внизу :) ] ->

This project was made with a framework for React.JS - Next.JS.

## Completed tasks:
1. Visualised app's main page according to the design that was sent to me.
2. Upon starting the application, user will see one starting trip to London. The list is scrollable.
3. When user selects a trip from the list, a forecast for each day of the trip  displayed.
4. On the top:
a. There should be a possibility to search for a trip
5. The app should include a button for adding a new trip. When the user clicks
on "Add trip," a modal window should appear. Inside the modal, the user
should have the ability to:
a. Choose a city from a predefined list (you should have a mock list of
cities that the API supports, with images).
b. Enter the start date of the trip (the start date should be within the next
15 days).
c. Enter the end date of the trip (the end date should be within the next 15
days).
Upon clicking "Done," the trip should be added to the list.

6. On the right side of the page:
a. When user selects a trip, today's weather forecast for that city should
be displayed.
b. There should be a countdown timer from the current date to the start
date of the trip.
